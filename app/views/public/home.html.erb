	<p>with the support and love of my family and friends, i have decide to live my dream. to be a creator. a crafter. an artist. i quit my job and decided to take the jump. to start my own business and follow my heart.</p>

	<p>it began with the book, the alchemist, given to me by my sister for christmas and finished with my husband asking me, "what are you waiting for?" so here i am, the master of my own future.</p>

	<p>i will be blogging every day (or almost every day), designing full-time for life's biggest events, creating handmade decor, and most of all loving life. hope you join me on my journey!</p>

	<p>*a big, dinosaur-size thank you to everyone who is helping me make this dream a reality!*</p>
